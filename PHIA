Accurately communicating probability is an important element of good-quality intelligence assessment. The agreed standard for conveying probability in intelligence analysis in the UK is the ‘PHIA probability yardstick’. This is a scale of probabilistic language developed by Defence Intelligence and latterly adopted by the PHIA for use across the government intelligence community. The scale comprises accepted intelligence terminology at a national level.

This scale demonstrates broad ranges of certainty or uncertainty that can be translated into consistent language. This language is then used in intelligence products in the context of any assessment, accompanied by the scale as an appendix to support interpretation.

PHIA probability yardstick table
| Probability range | Judgement terms |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| ≤ ≈ 5%            | Remote chance   |
| ≈ 10% to ≈ 20%    | Highly unlikely |
| ≈ 25% to ≈ 35%    | Unlikely        |
| ≈ 40% to <50%     | Realistic possibility |
| ≈ 55% to ≈ 75%    | Likely or probably    |
| ≈ 80% to ≈ 90%    | Highly likely         |
| ≥ ≈ 95%           | Almost certain        |

≈ approximately equal to
≥ is greater than or equal to
≤ is less than or equal to
< is less than

This consistent terminology also follows the national intelligence model (NIM) approach to common terminology and operating principles, whereby end users can expect to pick up an intelligence product from any individual in any force or agency and reliably know what the assessment is seeking to communicate around the certainty or otherwise of any judgements.

The scale was developed in response to two key challenges to effective intelligence assessment, namely the potential for:

misinterpretation – a lack of consistency in the use of language means that the same terms can be used to describe very different things, meaning that the findings of any assessment could be wrongly interpreted and therefore improperly acted on
misrepresentation – vagueness through a lack of consistency can lead to an intelligence assessment being accidentally or deliberately misrepresented by the end user, particularly if the work is quoted or collated into another product, potentially leading to inappropriate action.
